# Create bootable images

How to write an `iso` to a flash drive

## Ventoy

With ventoy you can create a bootable drive that automatically generates
a grub configuration for every bootable iso you copy onto the ventoy drive.
Very convenient, highly recommended.

## Under Linux

Use `dd`.

## Under Windows

Use Rufus. Just make sure what you create is not the legacy MBR, or just
don't use NTFS.
