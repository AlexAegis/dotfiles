# [Gentoo](https://wiki.gentoo.org/)

The install process is fairly similar to Arch's with minor differences. Like
instead of using a utility to set up the initial files on the new system
(pacstrap) you download and copy it manually. Another notable difference is, is
that there is no equivalent of `genfstab` to copy the currently mounted
devices into an fstab config. You have to do that manually. And of course the
option to manually configure your kernel.
