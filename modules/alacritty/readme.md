TODO: This package can be installed on arch with it's package manager
but not on ubuntu, on ubuntu, you have to build it.
TODO: The problem to tackle is conditional dependencies and scripts
even if you introduce a distro script or a cargo script the rust
dependency should only be active when not on arch
