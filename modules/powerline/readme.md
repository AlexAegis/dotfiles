The git submodule only needed when there is no easily accessable package
like the one in AUR

This module also tries to set the default system font too.

If the tty resolution is not set (usually it just uses the same resolution as `grub`, that resolution can be set by installing the `grub` dotmodule, the resultion will only install if `X` is working)
