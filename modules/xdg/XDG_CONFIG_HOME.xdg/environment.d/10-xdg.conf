# XDG Configuration

#
# Extended with https://theos.kyriasis.com/~kyrias/basedir-spec.html
#
# These variables can be changed however you like but when used you should
# always define the default defined by the spec too because by default these
# variables are not set and it's up to the programs and scripts to respect
# the spec, which should be done in these modules too.
#
# The 'Use as:' lines are there for spec reference, don't change them

# Make sure XDG variables are set
# https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/XDG_Base_Directory

## Spec

# Where user-specific data files should be written
# analogous to /usr/share
# Use as: ${XDG_DATA_HOME:-"$HOME/.local/share"}
# Defines the base directory relative to which user-specific data files
# should be stored.
# If $XDG_DATA_HOME is either not set or empty,
# a default equal to $HOME/.local/share should be used.
XDG_DATA_HOME="$HOME/.local/share"

# Where user-specific configurations should be written
# analogous to /etc
# Use as: ${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-"$HOME/.config"}
# Defines the base directory relative to which user-specific configuration
# files should be stored.
# If $XDG_CONFIG_HOME is either not set or empty,
# a default equal to $HOME/.config should be used.
XDG_CONFIG_HOME="$HOME/.config"

# Where user-specific non-essential (cached) data should be written
# analogous to /var/cache
# Use as: ${XDG_CACHE_HOME:-"$HOME/.cache"}
# Defines the base directory relative to which user specific non-essential
# data files should be stored.
# If $XDG_CACHE_HOME is either not set or empty,
# a default equal to $HOME/.cache should be used.
XDG_CACHE_HOME="$HOME/.cache"

# Used for non-essential, user-specific data files such as sockets, named pipes
# Has to be created on login and removed on logout. And it must have 700
# permissions.
# Systemd recommends having it under /run/user/
# A generator should set this, use that by default
# Use as: ${XDG_RUNTIME_DIR:-"/run/user/$USER"}
XDG_RUNTIME_DIR="${XDG_RUNTIME_DIR:-/run/user/$USER}"

## Extended spec

# Not part of the spec, but is the recommended place to place
# user specific binaries.
# It's proposed here: https://theos.kyriasis.com/~kyrias/basedir-spec.html
# analogous to /usr/local/bin
# Use as: ${XDG_BIN_HOME:-"$HOME/.local/bin"}
# Defines the base directory relative to which user-specific executable
# files should be stored.
# If $XDG_BIN_HOME is either not set or empty,
# a default equal to $HOME/.local/bin should be used.
XDG_BIN_HOME="$HOME/.local/bin"

# Not part of the spec, but is the recommended place to place
# user specific binaries.
# It's proposed here: https://theos.kyriasis.com/~kyrias/basedir-spec.html
# analogous to /usr/local/lib
# Use as: ${XDG_LIB_HOME:-"$HOME/.local/lib"}
# Defines the base directory relative to which user-specific
# architecture-independent library files should be stored.
# If $XDG_LIB_HOME is either not set or empty,
# a default equal to $HOME/.local/lib should be used.
XDG_LIB_HOME="$HOME/.local/lib"

# Defines the preference-ordered set of base directories to search
# for data files in addition to the $XDG_DATA_HOME base directory.
# The directories in $XDG_DATA_DIRS should be seperated with a colon ':'.
# If $XDG_DATA_DIRS is either not set or empty,
# a value equal to /usr/local/share:/usr/share should be used.
XDG_DATA_DIRS="/usr/local/share:/usr/share"

# Defines the preference-ordered set of base directories to search
# for configuration files in addition to the $XDG_CONFIG_HOME base directory.
# The directories in $XDG_CONFIG_DIRS should be seperated with a colon ':'.
# If $XDG_CONFIG_DIRS is either not set or empty,
# a value equal to /etc should be used.
XDG_CONFIG_DIRS="/etc"

# Defines the preference-ordered set of base directories to search for
# executable files in addition to the $XDG_BIN_HOME base directory.
# The directories in $XDG_BIN_DIRS should be seperated with a colon ':'.
# If $XDG_BIN_DIRS is either not set or empty,
# a value equal to /usr/local/bin:/usr/bin should be used.
XDG_BIN_DIRS="/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin"

# Defines the preference-ordered set of base directories to search for
# architecture-independent library files in addition to the $XDG_LIB_HOME
# base directory. The directories in $XDG_LIB_DIRS should be
# seperated with a colon ':'.
# If $XDG_LIB_DIRS is either not set or empty,
# a value equal to /usr/local/lib:/usr/lib should be used.
XDG_LIB_DIRS="/usr/local/lib:/usr/lib"

## Path

# Also added the bin directories to the path
PATH="$XDG_BIN_HOME:$XDG_BIN_DIRS:$PATH"
