My dotmodulesâ„¢, and a live example of
[pont](https://github.com/alexaegis/pont), my dotmodule manager.

## Install

This dotfiles repository is set up so `pont` is used as a module itself.
(Which is not necessary to use `pont`)

This will set up itself:

```sh
git clone --recurse-submodules -j8 \
  http://www.github.com/AlexAegis/dotfiles ~/.config/dotfiles
~/.config/dotfiles/modules/pont/pont.sh pont
```

If you use different folders than the default, for example, you want to
put your dotfiles to `~/.dotfiles` instead of the default `~/.config/dotfiles`
then before installing anything, set the `DOTFILES_HOME` variable beforehand.

```sh
export DOTFILES_HOME="$HOME/.dotfiles"
~/.dotfiles/modules/pont/pont.sh pont
```

Make sure pont's configs are available when you use them, it can't bootstrap
itself if the !

Then install whatever you'd like. For example, to bootstrap an arch system:

```sh
pont +arch
```

## On Windows

From a POSIX compatibility layer `pont` is usable. To reduce the required
complexity of mixed os modules, `pont` by default does not run `*.sh`
scripts and only invokes `*.ps1` PowerShell scripts on these environments.

### Setup

First install [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win).
You will need this to clone the `dotfiles` repository and it provides you a
`MINGW64` environment to run `pont` in.

> From `Git Bash`

```sh
git clone --recurse-submodules -j8 \
  http://www.github.com/AlexAegis/dotfiles ~/AppData/Roaming/dotfiles
```

The default `DOTFILES_HOME` location is not applicable on windows so you must
override it. You can invoke `PowerShell` from `Git Bash`.
The path has to be defined as it appears from `Git Bash`.

> Still from `Git Bash`

```sh
powershell "[Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable(
  'DOTFILES_HOME',
  '$HOME/AppData/Roaming/dotfiles',
  [EnvironmentVariableTarget]::User)"
```

Then have pont setup itself:

```sh
~/AppData/Roaming/dotfiles/modules/pont/pont.sh pont
```

After this you can use `pont`. Installing the `windows` preset:

```sh
pont +windows
```
