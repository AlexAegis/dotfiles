# Supports all expressions that the `dependencies` file supports

# Example:

other-arch-module ? [ $arch ]
other-void-module ? [ $void ]
+ubuntu-alternatives ?  [ $ubuntu ]

# Usually it's much simpler, and a single module is used

# Why not just delete?
# You can, of course. But I don't delete modules for two reason:
# - To keep them as reference
# - To remind me that I already tried it, and how I did it
#   Later it might get some improvements that would make me rethink it's usage
